# 401 Challenge 06: Linked List Kth From End

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

kth from end
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency

Work based on methods previously defined in Challenge 05.

## Structure & Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Write tests for the following scenarios, and any other cases that help you ensure your code is working as expected.

Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
Where k and the length of the list are the same
Where k is not a positive integer
Where the linked list is of a size 1
“Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code.

## Solution

Solution is in the code.
