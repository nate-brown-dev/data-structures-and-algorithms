## Approach & Efficiency

Work based on methods previously defined in Challenge 05.

## Structure & Testing

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code.

## Solution

Solution is in the code.
