# Code Challenge 36

Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation

### Feature Tasks

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- breadth first
  - Arguments: Node
  - Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
  - Display the collection

### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Example
Graph

Output:

Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstroplolis, Narnia, Naboo

### Stretch Goal

Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, define a new method that accepts two nodes as input and uses your traversal algorithm to determine if a path exists between the two nodes
