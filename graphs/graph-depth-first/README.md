Code Challenge
Conduct a depth first pre-order traversal on a graph

Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully.
Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.
Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.
Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: graph-depth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation

Feature Tasks
Write the following method for the Graph class:

Name: Depth first
Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
Program output: Display the collection
Example
Graph

Output: A, B, C, G, D, E, H, F

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Submission Instructions
Work within the proper folder structure for your language, and as dictated by the challenge instructions.
Create a new README for this challenge, using the README TEMPLATE provided.
Embed an image of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout
In addition to whiteboard drawing, complete the code written on your whiteboard, along with a proper suite of tests
Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch
