# Challenge 26: Insertion Sort

## Assignment

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

You may review an example document HERE

## Pseudocode

Insert(int[] sorted, int value)
  initialize i to 0
  WHILE value > sorted[i]
    set i to i + 1
  WHILE i < sorted.length
    set temp to sorted[i]
    set sorted[i] to value
    set value to temp
    set i to i + 1
  append value to sorted

InsertionSort(int[] input)
  LET sorted = New Empty Array
  sorted[0] = input[0]
  FOR i from 1 up to input.length
    Insert(sorted, input[i])
  return sorted
Sample Arrays
In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]

## Implementation

Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
